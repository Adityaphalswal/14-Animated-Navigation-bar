## Gradient :-
- There are two types of Gradient :-
    - Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
    - Radial Gradients (defined by their center)

### CSS Linear Gradients
- To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) along with the gradient effect.

- Syntax:- `background-image: linear-gradient(direction, color-stop1, color-stop2, ...)`
- Default Direction :- Top to bottom
### CSS Radial Gradients
- A radial gradient is defined by its center.
- syntax:- `background-image: radial-gradient(shape size at position, start-color, ..., last-color);`
- By default, shape is ellipse, size is farthest-corner, and position is center.
